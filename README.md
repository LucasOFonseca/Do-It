## About

Do It is a to-do list app where you can add tasks that you need remember later.

## Features
<strong>In this app, you can:</strong>

- Add tasks
- Edit any task
- Delete tasks
- Search tasks
- Toggle task situation to "in progress" or "completed"

## Resposive layout

  <img alt="Do It mobile" src=".github/doIt-mobile.png" width="25%">
</p>

This project is fully compatible with mobile devices of any size.

## Change

The "Add task" button has been moved from the end of the task list to the bottom right corner in floating format to facilitate the creation of new tasks when the user has a very large list of tasks.

## Technologies
This project was devolved with the following technologies:

- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript
- ReactJS

## Challenge difficulties

- At the beginning of development, make the communication between the aplication and the API.

- Send the task data to the edit screen with context API, because the  <em>task element</em> cannot access it.

- Handle API response status.

- Make the search bar work well.

  ## Fail
  - I tried to add a feature where the user could edit his name and function and save using Local Storage, but I coldn't make it work, so I abandoned the idea.

## How to run

In the project directory, run:

### `yarn start`

This command runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
